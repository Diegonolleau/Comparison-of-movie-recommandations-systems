This study aims to provide a clear presentation of the classical approaches used in movie 
recommendation systems, along with a comparative analysis of their results. By implementing 
and evaluating several well-established methods — including matrix factorization, content
based filtering, and user-based collaborative filtering — this work highlights the respective 
strengths and limitations of each technique. The evaluation is based on the MovieLens 1M 
dataset, a widely used benchmark in the academic field of recommender systems. The objective 
is to compare the predictive performance of these methods in order to better understand their 
specific characteristics and practical implications.
